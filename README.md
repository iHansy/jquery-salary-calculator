# Monthly Salary Calculator

## Description

In this project we used the annual salary of multiple employees to calculate the total monthly salary of all combined. We created functionality but adding multiple inputs, a submit button, and delete buttons. If the monthly total is over $20,000, the price gets highlighted in red. This way we know when we're over our budget.
