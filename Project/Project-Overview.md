                        MONTHLY SALARY CALCULATOR
Initial thoughts:
    - I want to work on this project from top of the page down, using the Wireframe example as reference.
    - I'd like to add styling with Bootstrap if there's time.
    - Create an id or class on every element for future planning.
    - Create html DOM visual first without JavaScript functionality.
    - Then add JS functionality.
    - DON'T FORGET 

Plan: 

html / css
    - Monthly Salary Calculator goes in a header
    - Put Add employee in an h2 or h3
    - Inputs should be inline
    - Submit button on line below
    - Employees in h2 or h3
    - Refresh memory on how to make a table with my notes and lecture notes
    - Explore borders. Use classes to organize tables and borders
    - Use the th element for table headers
    - Styles with Bootstrap at end!

JavaScript / jQuery
    - Submit button collects inputs and stores them into an array or variables. I think an array might be better so I can loop through it while appending.
    - Submit button appends employee info to DOM.
    - Submit button adds to monthly cost. If > 20k, monthly salary goes red.
    - Create a delete button that removes an employee, preferably removes from monthly cost as well.
